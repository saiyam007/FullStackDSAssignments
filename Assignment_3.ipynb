    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Reusability) - Once a function is written it can be called multiple times within the programs , This avoid duplicacy code and minimized the error and even also it can be shared with other programs to reducing the amount of code that has to be written from scratch (and retested) each time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Extensibility) - function provide us functionality to handle those cases which is not handled before , functions allow us to make the change in one place and have that change take effect every time the function is called.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.testing) - Since function reduce the code redundancy , so most of time we have less code to test and function is self contained , once we have tested a function and ensure it works, we don't need to test it again unless we have changed the code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Abstraction) - In order to use a function, you only need to know its name, inputs, outputs, and where it present. You don’t need to know how it works, or what other code it’s dependent upon to use it. This lowers the amount of knowledge required to use other people’s code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5.Organization) - This allows us to reduce a complicated program into smaller, more manageable chunks, which reduces the overall complexity of our program.\n",
